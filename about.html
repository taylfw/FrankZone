                In my free time I like drawing, reading, kayaking, playing bass, brewing beer and spending time with my wife and daughter.

	    My career thus far has been varied to say the least. I started out my adult life doing <b>manual labor</b> like digging ditches, planting trees bushes and flowers for a Landscaping company in the Florida heat. I became an <b>Emergency Medical Technician</b> and got my first job riding on an ambulance  few years later in Putnam county FL at the age of 21. I became a <b>Paramedic</b> at the age of 22 and began working for a private ambulance service in Jacksonville Florida. I worked there for 5 years. In this time I became interested in computer systems and started college classes pertaining to such. My last year in the medical field was spent working a night shift at a shipyard in Jacksonville while I studied network and system administration at Florida State College Jacksonville. I got my first IT job in 2016 at the age of 28. I‚Äôve spent the last five years performing <b>Desktop Support</b> and <b>Systems Administration</b> at Optimum Healthcare IT. I love troubleshooting complex and time sensitive problems. I also feel like I‚Äôve developed a lot of team work skills over the last decade. Coworkers give me the impression that they generally like working with me.

                Due to the recent pandemic, I turned to automating a few of my complicated yet repetitive and time consuming tasks using Powershell. This is when the coding bug bit me. I‚Äôve been teaching myself JavaScript ever since and don‚Äôt plan on slowing down. Web development allows me to be more creative and gives me the ability to show of my personal style in my work.
